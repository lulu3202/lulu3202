## **My Career Journey** 💼  
After earning my Master’s in Information Technology Management from UT Dallas, I gained diverse global experience across four firms, taking on roles in product management, security, and technology consulting:  

- **Product Specialist** – Dynata, Texas, USA  
- **Tech Consultant** – Deloitte, Texas, USA  
- **Security Program Manager** – Microsoft, Washington, USA  
- **Product Manager** – Microsoft, Washington, USA  
- **Technical Writer & Associate Engineer** – TCS, India  

During my last role at Microsoft, a business restructuring led to my position being offshored.  

I embraced this transition as an opportunity to evolve once again—this time, deepening my expertise in **Cloud, AI, and Generative AI!** 🧠
